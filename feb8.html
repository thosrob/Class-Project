      <p class="style">LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that
         the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with
         black highlighters.</p>
      <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an
         indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the
          agency's inception in 1947.</p>
      <p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will
        probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Cold War</li>
          <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
          <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
